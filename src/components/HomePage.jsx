          in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of alternative
          rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres
          such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music
          incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of many
          of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding
          members vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea (Michael Peter
          Balzary), longtime drummer Chad Smith, and former touring guitarist
          Josh Klinghoffer. Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling
          bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide, they
          have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards, of which they have won
          six, and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio
          history, currently holding the records for most number-one singles ,
          most cumulative weeks at number one and most top-ten songs on the
          Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In 2012, they were inducted into
          the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Source Wikipedia

          The Allman Brothers Band was an American rock band formed in
          Jacksonville, Florida in 1969 by brothers Duane Allman (founder, slide
          guitar and lead guitar) and Gregg Allman (vocals, keyboards,
          songwriting), as well as Dickey Betts (lead guitar, vocals,
          songwriting), Berry Oakley (bass guitar), Butch Trucks (drums), and
          Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson (drums). The band incorporated elements
          of blues, jazz, and country music, and their live shows featured jam
          band-style improvisation and instrumentals. The group's first two
          studio releases, The Allman Brothers Band (1969) and Idlewild South
          (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but
          their 1971 live release, At Fillmore East, represented an artistic and
          commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of
          their songs "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" and "Whipping Post", and is
          considered among the best live albums ever made. - Source Wikipedia

          Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 â€“ April 21, 2016), known
          mononymously as Prince, was an American singer, songwriter, musician,
          record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. A guitar virtuoso known
          for his genre-crossing work and flamboyant stage appearances, Prince
          is regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. His
          innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk,
          rock, R&B, new wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop. Prince pioneered the
          late 1970s Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre drawing from
          synth-pop and new wave. - Source Wikipedia
